String is an object, not a primitive. So, variables like String s; are references that point to the actual string data in heap memory.
When you pass a String to a method, Java passes a copy of the reference (not the object itself). Both the original and the copy point to the same object initially.
But String is immutable—you can't change its content once created. "Modifying" a string (e.g., with concat() or toUpperCase()) actually creates a new String object and returns a reference to it.
Crucially: You can't make the original reference point to a different object from inside the method, because you're working with a copy of the reference.
