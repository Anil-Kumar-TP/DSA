When you pass a primitive to a method, Java makes a copy of the value and sends that copy to the method.
Inside the method, you're working with this duplicate. Any changes you make? They only affect the copy—not the original variable outside the method.
Why? Primitives aren't references; they're just raw data. No memory address involved.
