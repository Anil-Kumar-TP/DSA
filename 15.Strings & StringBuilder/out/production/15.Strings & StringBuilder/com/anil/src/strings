what is the diff btw these
String name = "Anil"
name = name + "Kumar"

and
String name = "Anil"
name = "Kumar"



🔹 Case 1:
String name = "Anil";
name = name + "Kumar";

What happens:

"Anil" is created in the String pool.

Then name + "Kumar" creates a new String object "AnilKumar" in the heap (not the same pooled string), because string concatenation creates a new object.

name now points to this new "AnilKumar" object.

The original "Anil" string still exists in the pool but is no longer referenced by name.

🧠 So, this creates a new object each time you concatenate — strings are immutable.



Case 2:
String name = "Anil";
name = "Kumar";

What happens:

"Anil" and "Kumar" both exist in the String pool.

Initially, name points to "Anil".

When you reassign, name now points to the already pooled string "Kumar".

No new object is created during this reassignment — just the reference changes.

🧠 So, this only changes which pooled string the variable points to.


“Immutable” doesn’t mean “you can’t change the variable.”

It means you can’t change the actual String object in memory.

When you do:

String name = "Anil";
name = name + "Kumar";


you’re not changing the original "Anil" object.
You’re creating a brand new String object "AnilKumar" and making name point to it.

Think of it like this metaphor 👇

Concept	Analogy
name variable	A label stuck to a box
String object	The box itself (contains characters)
"Anil"	The first box
"AnilKumar"	A new box created when you concatenate

When you run name = name + "Kumar", you’re taking off the label from the first box and sticking it on a new box.
The old box ("Anil") stays untouched — that’s what immutability means.

🔹 To contrast with mutability

If it were mutable (like a StringBuilder):

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Anil");
sb.append("Kumar");


then the same object in memory gets modified — no new one is created.

So:

✅ You can change what the variable points to (the reference).

❌ You cannot change the contents of the string object it originally pointed to.
